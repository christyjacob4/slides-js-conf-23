# Core WebRTC APIs

There are 3 main APIs in WebRTC

<v-click>

**MediaStream ( aka getUserMedia )**

Gets access to data streams, such as from the user's camera and microphone.
</v-click>

<v-click>

**RTCPeerConnection**

Enables audio or video calling with facilities for encryption and bandwidth management.
</v-click>

<v-click>

**RTCDataChannel**

Enables peer-to-peer communication of generic data.
</v-click>

# MediaStream

MediaStream is an interface that represents a stream of media content. A stream consists of several tracks such as video or audio tracks.

```js{all|14-16}
var constraints = {
  video: true
};

function successCallback(stream) {
  var video = document.querySelector("#video");
  video.srcObject = stream; // video.src = window.URL.createObjectURL(stream);
}

function errorCallback(error) {
  console.log("navigator.getUserMedia error: ", error.message);
}

navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(constraints)
  .then(successCallback)
  .catch(errorCallback);
```

# MediaStream Constraints

MediaStream constraints are used to specify the different resolutions and frame rates for the video and audio tracks.

```js{all|2-4|5-7|8-10|11-13|15-18}
var options = {
  "480p": { 
    mandatory: { minWidth: 640, minHeight: 480 }
  },
  "720p": { 
    mandatory: { minWidth: 1280, minHeight: 720 }
  },
  "1080p": { 
    mandatory: { minWidth: 1920, minHeight: 1080 }
  },
  "2k": { 
    mandatory: { minWidth: 1920, minHeight: 1080 }
  },
};

var constraints = {
  video: options['1080p']
};

# RTCPeerConnection

RTCPeerConnection is the core of WebRTC. It is responsible for establishing a connection between two peers and exchanging media data. It handles a LOT of stuff behind the scenes

* Signal Processing
* Codec Handling
* Peer to peer communcation
* Security
* Bandwidth Management

# RTCPeerConnection Sample

```js{all|1-3|5-7|9|11-12|14-15|17|19-23}
const constraints = { 
  video: true 
};

const servers = { 
  iceServers: [{ urls: 'stun:stun.example.org' }] 
};

pc = new RTCPeerConnection(servers);

const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(constraints);
stream.getTracks().forEach((track) => pc.addTrack(track, stream));

const offer = await pc.createOffer();
await pc.setLocalDescription(offer);

await pc.setRemoteDescription(description) // get the answer SDP from the other peer

pc.onicecandidate = (event) => {
  if (event.candidate) {
    // send the candidate to the other peer
  }
};
```

# Deep Dive 

<div class="text-sm pr-2">

* Alice creates a new `RTCPeerConnection` and initiates a call with `createOffer()`.
* Bob also creates an `RTCPeerConnection` in preparation to receive the call.
* Alice handles the `onicecandidate` event by sending all ICE candidates to Bob & vice versa.
* Alice uses `setLocalDescription()` which starts the ICE negotiation process.
* Bob handles the `ontrack` event by attaching the remote stream to a video element.
* Bob uses `setRemoteDescription()` to set the remote description received from Alice & generates an answer.
* Finally Alice uses `setRemoteDescription()` to set the remote description received from Bob.

# Code Example 

```js{all|1|3-8|10|12|14-18|20-24|26|28-30|32-34|36} {maxHeight: '445px'}
let alice = new RTCPeerConnection(servers);

let localStream = await navigator.mediaDevices
  .getUserMedia(constraints);

localStream.getTracks().forEach((track) => 
  alice.addTrack(track, localStream)
);

let offer = await alice.createOffer()

let bob = new RTCPeerConnection(servers);

alice.onicecandidate = (event) => {
  if (event.candidate) {
    bob.addIceCandidate(event.candidate)
  }
}

bob.onicecandidate = (event) => {
  if (event.candidate) {
    alice.addIceCandidate(event.candidate)
  }
}

await alice.setLocalDescription(offer)

bob.ontrack = (event) => {
  video2.srcObject = event.stream;
}

bob.setRemoteDescription(offer)
let answer = bob.createAnswer()
bob.setLocalDescription(answer)

alice.setRemoteDescription(answer)

# Signalling

<div class="text-sm">

* Even though WebRTC is P2P, it does need a server to help initiate a connection
* The purpose of a signalling server is to help exchange information required to establish the P2P connection.
* The only information we need to exchange is the SDP & ICE candidates for both the peers.

<img src="webrtc-gist.png" class="h-52 my-4 mx-auto">

* Signalling server is simply a relay and does not need to interpret any of the information
* You can use any sort of mechanism for signalling - websockets, REST APIs, message queues, postcards, emails etc.
